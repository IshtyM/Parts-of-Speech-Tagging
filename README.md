# Parts-of-Speech-Tagging

In traditional grammar, a part of speech or part-of-speech is a category of words that have similar grammatical properties. “Parts of speech” are the basic types of words that English has.
It is a process of converting a sentence to forms – list of words, list of tuples (where each tuple is having a form (word, tag)). The tag in case of is a part-of-speech tag, and signifies whether the word is a noun, adjective, verb, and so on. Default tagging is a basic step for the part-of-speech tagging.

Here, markov Model is used in which three types of dictionaries are formed, i.e. transition matrix, emission matrix, and tag counts. Dealing with unkown words that are not find in vocabulary. 
Prediction of parts of speech is done for the testing data with accuracy of 86.58%.
